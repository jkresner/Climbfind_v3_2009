<p class="interviewQuestion">When did you first decide you were going to open your own climbing wall?</p>
<p>About 1997. Me and Rob Mirfin (Mirf) were working at the Rock Face (no longer exists) and I was sick to deather about them ripping everyone off (they weren’t), so we thought it would be nice to open all wall in Birmingham that was run by climbers. At the time there was probably less than 10 walls in the country.
We stopped working at Rockface and started looking for a building, put a business plan together and look at tons of buildings went to the 11th hour on some of them, and finally found Redpoint in 2007. Biggest problem was finding a building that was tall enough and had a long term lease in the right location.
For a while we were going to build in the Custard Factory and negotiated for 3 years and several other different buildings. There was a planning blight because there was a building that was licensed to store toxic chemicals.</p>

<p class="interviewQuestion">What was the most exciting moment along the journey so far?</p>
<p>When we first saw the inside of the building. We walked into a big building with a mezzanine level for the bouldering wall and a massive gantry crane that had so much steal that could be used for the structure of the climbing. It was a perfect blank canvas in a perfect location 7 minutes to walk from central Birmingham.
We the routes were set and matting was down (a day before we opened) I just felt relieved that we had worked 7 days a week for 9 months 14 hours a day and our big team of about 10 volunteers had finally finishing the construction. 
About 3000 people were on our mailing list before we opened, so we opted for a soft launch because we didn’t think we could cater for everyone.</p>
<p class="interviewQuestion">What was the most scariest moment along the journey?</p>
<p>Crash testing the Stalactite, because it fell over when we were hauling it. But it survived completely intact, so it was a great test for it. Unistrut (steel).</p>
<p class="interviewQuestion">Where there any dire moments when you thought it wasn’t going to happen?</p>
<p>All the times that the other buildings fell through were really disappointed.
We were both busy doing stuff (working snow and rock 7 days a week), we just thought we were never going to find a building. So I dropped my job to search for a building and we found it the next day. It had only gone on the market that week.</p>
<p class="interviewQuestion">How would you describe the vibe at Redpoint?</p>
<p>Happy, friendly, warm...
Non-elitist, helpful... Friendly wall they have been to... Aim toward the climbing and relates well to climbing on crags rather than being removed from crags. 3-dimensional, the routes are organic rather than straight up.
Too many climbing places that you go to, were the instructor doesn’t talk to the students. The very first time a client turns up, we teach them to belay so they can continue.</p>
<p class="interviewQuestion">Are their traces of influences from other walls or climbing places?</p>
<p>Undercover rock in Bristol where we used to Climb (Mirf) 15 years ago being one of the first walls in the country. We opted for flat panels and geometric shapes rather than straight up or curved resin because there are too many intrinsic foot holds to use and if you ever want to change parts of the wall it’s very easy to take panels off and just redesign it.
Climbing gritstone is not about climbing with holds its about find features and climbing grooves and arêtes and we based our structures around these concepts. We hope to teach people different styles that relate to outdoor climbing rather than just helping them get fit and strong.</p>
<p class="interviewQuestion">What is your favourite route in the building?</p>

<p class="interviewQuestion">Has it turned out so far like you imagined it would?</p>

<p class="interviewQuestion">Which climbers do you look up to and why?</p>

<p class="interviewQuestion">What is your favourite climbing moment?</p>

<p class="interviewQuestion">A place that you have never climbed that would love to make your way to?</p>

<p class="interviewQuestion">Plans for the future, what can we expect from The Redpoint Centre over the next 18 months?</p>


<p class="interviewQuestion">Not just a fun fare ride.</p>

<p>For many years Southern Thailand has been one of the world's climbing Mecca’s. In this article I offer my opinions on a month's climbing and climbing travel in Southern Thailand. </p><p>My 4 weeks from Feb 7 to Mar 7 were split between the island <a href="/places/outdoor-rock-climbing/thailand/koh-phi-phi">Koh Phi Phi</a> and the Phra Nang Bay region which is a peninsula made up of <a href="/places/outdoor-rock-climbing/thailand/railay-west">Railay Beach West</a>, <a href="/places/outdoor-rock-climbing/thailand/railay-east">Railay Beach East</a>, <a href="/places/outdoor-rock-climbing/thailand/tonsai-beach-phra-nang-bay">Tonsai Beach</a> & <a href="/places/outdoor-rock-climbing/thailand/phranang-beach">Phranang Beach</a>. </p><h2>Koh Phi Phi</h2><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-_4l8FDjtzk&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-_4l8FDjtzk&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>  <p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px"><i><b>Views of Phi Phi from Tonsai Tower</b></i></p><p>In week 1, I met <b><a href="/climber-profile/63cd3eec-67e4-4d45-bf09-3f318726de86">Erin Jenkins</a></b> & <b><a href="/climber-profile/8e2c4be3-39a0-4039-a171-0f5fed6b2ca2">Adam Jacobs</a></b> in Phi Phi. After being advised that the island was over touristy and the climbing crap, I was pleasantly surprised that I left with contradicting opinions that I put this down to the recent work by resident bolters and the rebuilding of Phi Phi since the Tsunami. Before I had even made it to the island, the others had sought out all the local beta on when are where to climb. They had found Magnus and Shamick, two old-school western climbers who had been bolting around Railay for over a decade but had moved on to rebolt Phi Phi. After years of watching expansion bolts & stainless steel bolts corrode under the harsh coastal conditions these guys had decided to restore Phi Phi using titanium ring bolts & red epoxy glue. We climbed on two of the seven walls and here are my thoughts on both.</p><img src="/images/news/2009-03/southern-thailand-by-jonathon-kresner/JK-on-tonsai-tower-by-david-rizzi.jpg" alt="Half way up tonsai tower" /><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px"><i><b>View of Koh Phi Phi from half way up Tonsai Tower (Note the video is wrong, it is not looking at Tonsai Beach).</b><br /> Photo by the up and coming Italian climbing photographer <a href="http://www.anafricanphotoblog.com/" target="_blank"><b>David Rizzi</b></a></i></p><p><b><a href="/places/outdoor-rock-climbing/thailand/koh-phi-phi/wall/tonsai-tower">Tonsai Tower</a></b> <i>(Note this wall is on Phi Phi and has nothing to do with Tonsai Beach near Railay)</i>: Since most routes were around F5+ and low 6's (see <a href="/Glossary/GradeConverter">grade chart</a> if you want to convert) I didn't find it to be rewarding in for its climbing, however the views were spectacular and it is perfect for beginners and getting used to the feeling of Thai limestone.</p><img src="/images/news/2009-03/southern-thailand-by-jonathon-kresner/the-drinking-wall.JPG" alt="Half way up the drinking wall" /><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px"><i><b>The suspended stalactite on the F6B+ route "Hangover".</b><br /> Photo by Jonathon Kresner</i></p><p><b><a href="/places/outdoor-rock-climbing/thailand/koh-phi-phi/wall/the-drinking-wall">The Drinking Wall</a></b>: Is my favourite of all the walls that I visited while in Thailand. It is made up of one F5+, one F7Cand a bunch of quality routes in between. Hangover (6B+) is the most enjoyable climb I have ever done. The route starts with a bouldery layback which transitions into an easy 3m traverse that ends with a dramatic bridge onto the most stunning suspended stalactite. From there you climb around and then on top of the stalactite to finish the route with a 10m vertical climb. At the top the views are breath taking. You can see both bays on either side of Phi Phi and a ton of the surrounding jungle. While at Drinking Wall watch out for monkeys raiding your lunch and armies of mosquitoes that appear past 5PM.</p><h2>Phra Nang Bay</h2><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/U2YpYn6PAoM&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/U2YpYn6PAoM&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px"><i><b>Walking down Tonsai Beach</b></i></p><p>The next 2 1/2 weeks in the Prahnang Bay region were split between Railay East and Tonsai. If you go to this area, make sure you stay in Tonsai because Railay East is an absolute dump, you can't swim on the beach because there is so much rubbish everywhere. Tonsai is also cheaper and it is where all the climbers hang out.</p><p>I think the fun thing about climbing around the Phranag Bay peninsula is because it is like a climbing Disneyland. Every morning you wake up and you have a choice of about 60 walls all within a 5 to 90 minutes walk from your bungalow. To keep this article reasonable, I'll mention only my favourite wall here:</p><img src="/images/news/2009-03/southern-thailand-by-jonathon-kresner/aj-burnt-offerings.jpg" alt="Burnt Offerings, Fire Wall, Tonsai Beach" /><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px"><i><b>AJ Climbing the Roof of Burnt Offerings (7A+), Fire Wall, Tonsai Beach</b><br /> Photo by <a href="/climber-profile/8f2562f8-eab9-4fdd-a68c-03be96eb0769">Anna Breaks</a></i></p><p><b>Fire wall: </b> Is located right next to Tonsai Beach and is a good wall for first timers and intermediates climbing up to F7A+. The routes are full of character and the views are simply epic. The Grove Tube (4 star, F6A) is infamous for its 25m long half tube that anchor on a ledge where you can shake out looking onto the whole bay. Another route that is just spectacular is F7A+ Burnt Offerings which starts inside a cave where you have to climb the roof and finally come out onto the face of the cliff. Big congratulations to <a target="_blank" href="/Climber-Profile/19993a66-40d2-49b2-9d2a-30abaf29e31c">Antoine Bouchard</a> who I met on the route and after projected it for 2 months and sent it two days before he left Thailand!</p> <p>Another must while at Tonsai is go out for day's worth of deep water soloing. There are two ways to go deep water. If you are a beginner, you are by yourself or the type of person who likes everything organised for you, book a half day deep water solo tour with Wee's climbing school which costs around 700 Bhat with lunch included. Alternatively, if you can get 7-9 people together, you can hire a long tail boat for a whole day at half the price and get the driver to take you to The Playdium Wall, Spider Man Wall as well as bouldering on a gorgeous beach right next to Playdium.</p><img src="/images/news/2009-03/southern-thailand-by-jonathon-kresner/bouldering-on-the-beach.JPG" alt="Bouldering on the beach" /><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px"><i><b>Bouldering on the beach next to Playdium Wall</b><br /> Photo by Jonathon Kresner</i></p><table class="NoStylesTable"><tr><td><img src="/images/news/2009-03/southern-thailand-by-jonathon-kresner/the-gang-on-the-longtail.JPG" alt="Bouldering on the beach" /></td><td style="padding-left:10px"><img src="/images/news/2009-03/southern-thailand-by-jonathon-kresner/feeding-rainbow-fish.JPG" alt="Bouldering on the beach" /></td></tr><tr><td><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px"><i>Our gang on the longtail boats</i></p></td><td><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px"><i>Feeding rainbow fish on the bouldering beach</i></p></td></tr><tr><td><img src="/images/news/2009-03/southern-thailand-by-jonathon-kresner/Beach-Bouldering.JPG" alt="Bouldering on the beach" /></td><td style="padding-left:10px"><img src="/images/news/2009-03/southern-thailand-by-jonathon-kresner/longtails-under-spiderman-wall.JPG" alt="Bouldering on the beach" /></td></tr><tr><td><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px"><i>Bouldering overhangs above the sand</i></p></td><td><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px"><i>Longtails underneath The Spider Man Wall</i></p></td></tr></table><p>I hope you enjoyed my summary of Southern Thailand, it is nowhere near complete rather only my experiences. You could easily spend 3-6 months scoping Southern Thailand out. If you decide to go, here are my top 5 travel tips:</p><ul><li>1) <b>Use electrote sachets</b>, the local water does not have the necessary nutrients to replenish you after climbing, they will save you bi time.</li><li>2) <b>Wear Crocks</b> instead of stubbing / cutting your feet every couple of days and getting them infected.</li><li>3) <b>Skip rooms with air conditioning</b>, it stops you getting used to the climate and increases the ods of getting sick.</li><li>4) <b>Go to Phi Phi & visit The Drinking Wall</b>, most people miss it because they don't know.</li><li>5) <b>Visit the Tonsai Chicken lady before 9am</b> if you want the best ever fried chicken for lunch!</li></ul>
