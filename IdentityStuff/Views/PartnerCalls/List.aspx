<h1>Climbing partners</h1>

<p>Climbfind is a <i>climber's social network</i> with the purpose of helping people find regular rock
climbing partners and one off climbing partners.</p>

<p>No site in the world connects you to the climbing world better than us. This is a quick guide to help you get the most out of
finding climbers on our site:</p>

<h3>1) Making yourself visible to other climbers</h3>

<p>There are two methods to make yourself visible, each with a differing purposes:</p>

<p><b>a) Posting partner calls:</b>  If you want to find more people to climb with but either don't have a date in mind, or you have a large range of dates,
<a href="/post-an-ad-for-rock-climbing-partners">post a partner call</a> once listing all the places where you are looking for new climbing partners.
If you decide you don't want to be contacted for that place any more, you can delete your partner call from your
<a target="_blank" href="/ClimberProfiles/Me">profile</a> page.</p>

<span style="margin:0px 0px 20px 40px;display:block"><b>In summary: </b> A <i>partner call</i> is like an add for a climbing partner that stays up until you decide you want to take it down.</span>

<p><b>b) Posting to the climbing feed:</b> If you are looking for someone to climb with at a specific time and place, you should <a target="_blank" href="/CFFeed/NewPost">post to the feed</a> using the tag
<i>#NeedPartner</i>. Posting to the feed is especially useful if you want to find a last minute climbing partner.</p>

<span style="margin:0px 0px 20px 40px;display:block"><b>In summary: </b> A <i>feed post</i> stays visible for a short period of time and is useful when people are looking for
 who is climbing in the future at the same place they climb.</span>
