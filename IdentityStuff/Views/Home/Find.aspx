<h1>Climbfind v3.0 (A.K.A CF3) - Coming End of July</h1>

<p>Climbfind beta was launched in London, England 9 months ago as a niche indoor climbing site with the purpose of helping 
people find indoor climbing partners. 

4 months into our journey we released CFv1.0 which included functionality to help people find each other outdoors. 
After 6 months we decided it was time for our pilot period in the U.K. market to end, so
 we released CFv2.0 which gave users the ability to spawn their own geographical
 communities all around the world by adding their favourite climbing places to our world climbing map.</p>

<p>Until now our focus has been to help people find partners. This has limited our audience to only a small
proportion of the climbing community, who were actually looking for a climbing partner. However, <b>The Climbfind
philosophy is to help others even at moments when you are all sorted with people to climb with</b>, so that one day 
when you travel or move or 
explore a new area, someone will be there to help you.
<b><i>CF3</i></b> will 
 incorporate functionality to move Climbfind away from its "partner call" niche to
 also connect climbers in the follow scenarios:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1) I don't need a partner, but I'm interested in meeting more climbers who climb at places I climb.</li>
    <li>2) I'm going bouldering. Would be cool if someone, or even a bunch of people joined me... but it's not really essential.</li>
    <li>3) I don't need a climbing partner, but would love to car pool and share fuel costs to the crag.</li>
    <li>4) I'm happy to help randoms by letting them join my climbing friends for a session (Share the love!)</li>
    <li>5) I don't need a partner, but I'm looking for info on a place from someone who has climbed there recently.</li>
    <li>6) I want to know where my friends are climbing so we can meet up.</li>
    <li>7) I want to ... (your suggestion here)</li>
</ul>
