<h1>CF3 Beta Testing Brief</h1>

<div class="attentionDIV">Please read this document from bottom up (chronological order) and revisit it for updates.</div>

<p class="Date">Jul 22, 2009 <b>Testing context, TODO & new features</b></p>

<p>Sorry for not making clear exactly what is going on. CF3 is all about the new homepage and the *Feed* feature. All the
links from the CF3 homepage go back to normal CF2 pages which you do not need to test. What we need each beta tester to do is:</p>

<p>1) Customise the CF3 homepage.</p>
<p>2) Post to the feed.</p>
<p>3) Play with the feed channels and views.</p>
<p>4) Add people to their climbers channel.</p>

<p>We've completed movie integration into the feed and the Climber's channel channel is coming along although
the adding / blocking people needs refining. The climbers channel is sort of like twitter -
'Climbers your watching / following'. In the future we plan on having the climbfind feed post automatically to your
twitter feed if you have one. If you played with the site a couple of days feel free to play again.</p>

<p class="Date">Jul 22, 2009 <b>Let the week of beta testing begin!</b></p>

<p>Ok so this first test version today (v3.0alpha) is incomplete and rough around the edges. It is more of a preview than a
a beta, i.e. not everything is finished and lots is still to be built in the next week. What we are looking for over the next 2-3 days is your feelings about the concept,
whether you think it is easy to understand. We are also trying to populate it with some real life data to see if it comes together and if you have
ideas of how to improve it, email jkresner@climbfind.com</p>

<p class="Date">Jul 15, 2009 <b>Problems we are trying to solve in CF3</b></p>


<p>A large percentage of users sign up and come back infrequently. 
Therefore our mission to connect climbers often fails because people in the same areas join the site in different months
and don't end up finding each other.</p> 

<p>We feel there are three main reasons holding the site back:
<br /> #1 Relevancy of CF2 to only a small portion of the climbing community (those looking for partners).
<br /> #2 Low percentage of the community returning on weekly basis.
<br /> #3 Current functionality not making relevant users visible enough to each other.
</p>

<p><i>Introducing the 'CF3 Homepage' and the new 'CF Feed'</i></p>

<p>The CF2 homepage will be replaced with a more interactive and
customable homepage containing The new "CF Feed", a "Beta" section - which is meant to be intelligent 'what next tips' flagging 'to dos'
on the site and finally, a single, more customable "Partner calls feed" instead of seperate ones for next 48 hours/indoor & outdoor.</p>

<p>The CF Feed (official name yet to come) is meant to be a hybrid twitter/facebook status/climbfind type feed.
Most simply put the feed is meant to express where and when people are climbing. By giving users the ability to
view the feed filtered by #1 Area (e.g. State/'California' or City/'London'), #2 a single place (e.g. your local gym or a
 destination like Yosemite) #3 by climbers of interest (e.g. friends or famous climbers) we aim to 
 let climbers use the feed for much more than find partners and thus open up Climbfind's market to all climbers.
 Tags like #NeedBelay #WantToCarPool, #GotCampSiteToShare & #WantBeta will help people 
 solve a whole range of scenarios that have not been solved by any other site on the web.</p>

<p class="Date">Jul 14, 2009 <b>Context of the Climbfind Project</b></p>



<p>If you are interested in the context of CF3 and where Climbfind has come from over the last 10 months read
the <a href="/Find">about CF3</a>...</p>


<p class="Date">Jul 13, 2009 <b>Why community test CF3?</b></p>


<p>The two reasons we are involving the community is #1 to get feedback and
#2 your help in spreading the word to the global climbing scene.</p>


<p>On the 31st of July, we aim to create as much internet buzz as possible. Here are things you can do to help:</p>              

<ul style="margin-left:0px">
    <li>1) If you run a blog, prepared a blog entry on CF3. Post it on the July 31st.</li>
    <li>2) On the 31st of July share a link on facebook to the "About CF3 page" (we will give you a link a few days before).</li>
    <li>3) Share the link to the "About CF3 page" on twitter a couple of times during the day.</li>
    <li>4) If you participate on climbing forums, create a thread with a link about CF3.</li>
    <li>5) Give us your ideas on how to spread the word...</li>
</ul>

<p class="Date">Jul 12, 2009 <b>Feedback</b></p>

<p>This is an iterative process. Please send me as much feedback as possible to jkresner@climbfind.com</p>
<p><b>Thank you for participating!</b></p>
